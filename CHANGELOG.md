# Change Log

## v0.3.1

- Improved initialization routine as middleware
- Implemented "remember me" for persistent sessions - see https://github.com/gbirke/rememberme
- Converted page templates to inheritance architecture, using Twig `extends`
- Start using the `.twig` extension for template files
- All content is now part of a theme, and site can be configured so that one theme is the default theme for unauthenticated users
- User session stored via `user_id`, rather than the entire User object
- Data model is now built on Eloquent, instead of in-house
- Cleaned up some of the per-page Javascript, refactoring repetitive code
- Implement server-side pagination
- Upgrade to Tablesorter v2.23.4
- Switch from DateJS to momentjs
- Switch to jQueryValidation from FormValidation
- Implement basic interface for modifying group authorization rules
- User events - timestamps for things like sign-in, sign-up, password reset, etc are now stored in a `user_event` table
- Wrapper class Notification for sending emails, other notifications to users
- Remove username requirement for password reset.  It is more likely that an attacker would know the user's username, than the user themselves.  For the next version, we can try to implement some real multi-factor authentication.
- When a user creates another user, they don't need to set a password.  Instead, an email is sent out to the new user, with a token allowing them to set their own password.
- Admins can manually generate a password reset request for another user, or directly change the user's password.
